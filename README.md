# Sarita Chatbot

Sarita is a personal chatbot designed to represent Sara Mirjalili. It answers questions about her resume, background, interests, and experience.

This project showcases Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities by integrating spaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER), NLTK for language processing, and Transformers for contextual conversation handling.

The goal of Sarita is to provide meaningful, intelligent interactions, using NLP techniques to offer more than simple keyword-based responses.
